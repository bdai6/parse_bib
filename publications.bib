  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are enjoying rapidly increasing adoption. However, designing and implementing the systems that support ML models in real-world deployments remains a significant obstacle, in large part due to the radically different development and deployment profile of modern ML methods, and the range of practical concerns that come with broader adoption. We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, SysML, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.},

abstract={Emerging neural hardware substrates, such as IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, can provide an appealing platform for deploying numerical algorithms. For example, a recurrent Hopfield neural network can be used to find the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a matrix, thus enabling a broad class of linear optimizations to be solved efficiently, at low energy cost. However, deploying numerical algorithms on hardware platforms that severely limit the range and precision of representation for numeric quantities can be quite challenging. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes a rigorous mathematical framework for reasoning about range and precision on such substrates. The paper derives techniques for normalizing inputs and properly quantizing synaptic weights originating from arbitrary systems of linear equations, so that solvers for those systems can be implemented in a provably correct manner on hardware-constrained neural substrates. The analytical model is empirically validated on the IBM TrueNorth platform, and results show that the guarantees provided by the framework for range and precision hold under experimental conditions. Experiments with optical flow demonstrate the energy benefits of deploying a reduced-precision and energy-efficient generalized matrix inverse engine on the IBM TrueNorth platform, reflecting 10× to 100× improvement over FPGA and ARM core baselines.},

abstract={Associative Processing (AP) is a promising alternative to the Von Neumann model as it addresses the memory wall problem through its inherent in-memory computations. However, because of the countless design parameter choices, comparisons between implementations of two so radically different models are challenging for simulation-based methods. To tackle these challenges, we develop an alternative analytical approach based on a new concept called architecturally-determined complexity. Using this method, we asymptotically evaluate the runtime/storage/energy bounds of the two models, i.e., AP and Von Neumann. We further apply the method to gain more insights into the performance bottlenecks of traditional AP and develop a new machine model named Two Dimensional AP to address these limitations. Finally, we experimentally validate our analytical method and confirm that the simulation results match our theoretical projections.},

abstract={This work demonstrates the first fabricated 1 Mb nonvolatile TCAM using 2-transistor/2-resistive-storage (2T-2R) cells to achieve >10× smaller cell size than SRAM-based TCAMs at the same technology node. The test chip was designed and fabricated in IBM 90 nm CMOS technology and mushroom phase-change memory (PCM) technology. The primary challenge for enabling reliable array operation with such aggressive cell is presented, namely, severely degraded sensing margin due to significantly lower ON/OFF ratio of resistive memories (~10^2 for PCM) than that of traditional MOSFETs (>10^5 ). To address this challenge, two enabling techniques were developed and implemented in hardware: 1) two-bit encoding and 2) a clocked self-referenced sensing scheme (CSRSS). In addition, the two-bit encoding can also improve algorithmic mapping by effectively compressing TCAM entries. The 1 Mb chip demonstrates reliable low voltage search operation (VDDmin ~750 mV) and a match delay of 1.9 ns under nominal operating conditions.},

 abstract={A nonvolatile fully programmable processing-in-memory (PIM) processor named Liquid Silicon (L-Si) is demonstrated, which combines the superior programmability of general-purpose computing devices (e.g. FPGA) and the high power efficiency of domain-specific accelerators. Besides the general computing applications, L-Si is particularly well suited for AI/machine learning and big data applications, which not only pose high computational/memory demand but also evolves rapidly. L-Si is fabricated by monolithically integrating HfO 2 resistive RAM on top of commercial 130nm Si CMOS. Our measurement confirmed the fabricated chip operates reliably at low voltage of 650 mV. It achieves 60.9 TOPS/W in performing neural network inferences and 480 GOPS/W in performing content-based similarity search (a key big data application) at nominal voltage supply of 1.2V, showing >3× and ~100× power efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art domain-specific CMOS-/RRAM-based accelerators. In addition, it outperforms the latest nonvolatile FPGA in energy efficiency by ~3× in general compute-intensive applications.},

 abstract={Emerging 3D memory technologies, such as the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), provide increased bandwidth and massive memory-level parallelism. Efficiently integrating emerging memories into existing system pose new challenges and require detailed evaluation in a real computing environment. In this paper, we propose MEG, an open-source, configurable, cycle-exact, and RISC-V based full system simulation infrastructure using FPGA and HMC. MEG has three highly configurable design components: (i) a HMC adaptation module that not only enables communication between the HMC device and the processor cores but also can be extended to fit other memories (e.g., HBM, nonvolatile memory) with minimal effort, (ii) a reconfigurable memory controller along with its OS support that can be effectively leveraged by system designers to perform software-hardware co-optimization, and (iii) a performance monitor module that effectively improves the observability and debuggability of the system to guide performance optimization. We provide a prototype implementation of MEG on Xilinx VCU110 board and demonstrate its capability, fidelity, and flexibility on real-world benchmark applications. We hope that our open-source release of MEG fills a gap in the space of publicly-available FPGA-based full system simulation infrastructures specifically targeting memory system and inspires further collaborative software/hardware innovations.},

 abstract={Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging due to their large size and complexity. Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models. However, these studies usually do not consider the changes in the loss function when performing quantization, nor do they take the different importances of DNN model parameters to the accuracy into account. We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each network parameter such that the increase in loss is minimized. The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each parameter and assigns it a precision accordingly. Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates. Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.},

 abstract={With the recent trend of promoting Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to first-class citizens in accelerating compute-intensive applications in networking, cloud services and artificial intelligence, FPGAs face two major challenges in sustaining competitive advantages in performance and energy efficiency for diverse cloud workloads: 1) limited configuration capability for supporting light-weight computations/on-chip data storage to accelerate emerging search-/data-intensive applications. 2) lack of architectural support to hide reconfiguration overhead for assisting virtualization in a cloud computing environment. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable memory-oriented computing fabric, namely Liquid Silicon-Monona (L-Si), enabled by emerging nonvolatile memory technology i.e. RRAM, to address these two challenges. Specifically, L-Si addresses the first challenge by virtue of a new architecture comprising a 2D array of physically identical but functionally-configurable building blocks. It, for the first time, extends the configuration capabilities of existing FPGAs from computation to the whole spectrum ranging from computation to data storage. It allows users to better customize hardware by flexibly partitioning hardware resources between computation and memory, greatly benefiting emerging search- and data-intensive applications. To address the second challenge, L-Si provides scalable multi-context architectural support to minimize reconfiguration overhead for assisting virtualization. In addition, we provide compiler support to facilitate the programming of applications written in high-level programming languages (e.g. OpenCL) and frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, MapReduce) while fully exploiting the unique architectural capability of L-Si. Our evaluation results show L-Si achieves 99.6\% area reduction, 1.43× throughput improvement and 94.0\% power reduction on search-intensive benchmarks, as compared with the FPGA baseline. For neural network benchmarks, on average, L-Si achieves 52.3× speedup, 113.9× energy reduction and 81\% area reduction over the FPGA baseline. In addition, the multi-context architecture of L-Si reduces the context switching time to - 10ns, compared with an off-the-shelf FPGA (∼100ms), greatly facilitating virtualization.},

 abstract={Graph traversal is a core primitive for graph analytics and a basis for many higher-level graph analysis methods. However, irregularities in the structure of scale-free graphs (e.g., social network) limit our ability to analyze these important and growing datasets. A key challenge is the redundant graph computations caused by the presence of high-degree vertices which not only increase the total amount of computations but also incur unnecessary random data access. In this paper, we present a graph processing system on an FPGA-HMC platform, based on software/hardware co-design and co- optimization. For the first time, we leverage the inherent graph property i.e. vertex degree to co-optimize algorithm and hardware architecture. In particular, we first develop two algorithm optimization techniques:degree-aware adjacency list reordering anddegree-aware vertex index sorting. The former can reduce the number of redundant graph computations, while the latter can create a strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency, which can be effectively applied to guide the hardware design. We further implement the optimized hybrid graph traversal algorithm on an FPGA-HMC platform. By leveraging the strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency made by degree-aware vertex index sorting, we develop two platform-dependent hardware optimization techniques, namely degree-aware data placement and degree-aware adjacency list compression. These two techniques together substantially reduce the amount of access to external memory. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on an FPGA-HMC platform to verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation achieves the highest performance (45.8 billion traversed edges per second) among existing FPGA-based graph processing systems.},

 abstract={This paper presents a data-centric reconfigurable architecture, namely Liquid Silicon, enabled by emerging non-volatile memory, i.e., RRAM. Compared to the heterogeneous architecture of commercial FPGAs, Liquid Silicon is inherently a homogeneous architecture comprising a two-dimensional (2D) array of identical 'tiles'. Each tile can be configured into one or a combination of four modes: TCAM, logic, interconnect, and memory. Such flexibility allows users to partition resources based on applications? needs, in contrast to the fixed hardware design using dedicated hard IP blocks in FPGAs. In addition to better resource usage, its 'memory friendly' architecture effectively addresses the limitations of commercial FPGAs i.e., scarce on-chip memory resources, making it an effective complement to FPGAs. Moreover, its coarse-grained logic implementation results in shallower logic depth, less inter-tile routing overhead, and thus smaller area and better performance, compared with its FPGA counterpart. Our study shows that, on average, for both traditional and emerging applications, we achieve 62\% area reduction, 27\% speedup and 31\% improvement in energy efficiency when mapping applications onto Liquid Silicon instead of FPGAs.},

 abstract={Graph analytics, which explores the relationships among interconnected entities, is becoming increasingly important due to its broad applicability, from machine learning to social sciences. However, due to the irregular data access patterns in graph computations, one major challenge for graph processing systems is performance. The algorithms, softwares, and hardwares that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are generally not effective for massive, sparse graphs from the real-world problems, due to their complex and irregular structures. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we leverage the exceptional random access performance of the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) combined with the flexibility and efficiency of modern FPGAs. In particular, we develop a collaborative software/hardware technique to perform a level-synchronized Breadth First Search (BFS) on a FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that exploits the FPGA-HMC platform»s capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by designing a memory request merging unit to take advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluate the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron and achieve $2.8 \times$ average performance improvement compared to the latest FPGA-HMC based graph processing system over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications.},

One interesting work is a RRAM-based reconfigurable architecture that provides superior programmbility and blurs the boundary between computation and storage, but long-distance routing becomes a performance bottleneck. However, long-distance routing in FPGA is efficiently implemented, but its fine-grained routing structure results in a large routing overhead. In this work, we present a RRAM-based reconfigurable architecture that addresses the routing challenges using hybrid routing, i.e., local and global routing by taking the best advantages of both architectures (prior RRAM-based and FPGA). We also provide a complete CAD framework that exhibits high parallelism and good scalability. Experimental results show that our reconfigurable architecture outperforms both architectures. It achieves a 46.88\% reduction in delay and improves the energy efficiency by 66.23\% compared with the prior RRAM-based architecture with a slightly increased area overhead. While comparing with FPGA, it reduces the delay and the routing overhead by 36.00\% and 50.20\%, respectively. Additionally, our CAD framework achieves 5.39x speedup, compared with the prior framework.},

 abstract={OpenCL FPGA has recently gained great popularity with emerging needs for workload acceleration such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is the most popular deep learning architecture in the domain of computer vision. While OpenCL enhances the code portability and programmability of FPGA, it comes at the expense of performance. The key challenge is to optimize the OpenCL kernels to efficiently utilize the flexible hardware resources in FPGA. Simply optimizing the OpenCL kernel code through various compiler options turns out insufficient to achieve desirable performance for both compute-intensive and data-intensive workloads such as convolutional neural networks.

In this paper, we first propose an analytical performance model and apply it to perform an in-depth analysis on the resource requirement of CNN classifier kernels and available resources on modern FPGAs. We identify that the key performance bottleneck is the on-chip memory bandwidth. We propose a new kernel design to effectively address such bandwidth limitation and to provide an optimal balance between computation, on-chip, and off-chip memory access. As a case study, we further apply these techniques to design a CNN accelerator based on the VGG model. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our CNN accelerator using an Altera Arria 10 GX1150 board. We achieve 866 Gop/s floating point performance at 370MHz working frequency and 1.79 Top/s 16-bit fixed-point performance at 385MHz. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation achieves the best power efficiency and performance density compared to existing work.},

abstract={Driven by recent advances in resistive random-access memory (RRAM), there have been growing interests in exploring alternative computing concept, i.e., in-memory processing, to address the classical von Neumann bottlenecks. Despite of their great promise in improving performance and energy efficiency, most existing works are built on the inherent matrix-vector multiplication capability of RRAM crossbar structure, and thus lack the flexibility to adapt to future market/technology induced changes in data-intensive applications. To address these challenges, we propose an in-memory reconfigurable architecture based on RRAM crossbar structure. For the first time, it achieves a full programmability across computation and storage, and thereby provides more flexibilities of partitioning the hardware resources based on applications' needs. We further develop two complete CAD design flows to facilitate development of applications written in hardware description languages (HDLs) for our architecture, based on: 1) adaption from existing tool set developed for FPGA, 2) a custom tool design optimized towards the new architecture. Our experiments show that, both design flows are effective in exploiting flexible resources offered by our architecture and thus achieves better efficiency than state-of-art FPGAs (30\% improvement in performance with 66\% reduction in area). In addition, compared to adapted design flow, our custom design flow achieves speedup by 3.3×, and further improves mapping quality.},

abstract={DRAM-based main memories have read operations that destroy the read data, and as a result, must buffer large amounts of data on each array access to keep chip costs low. Unfortunately, system-level trends such as increased memory contention in multi-core architectures and data mapping schemes that improve memory parallelism lead to only a small amount of the buffered data to be accessed. This makes buffering large amounts of data on every memory array access energy-inefficient; yet organizing DRAM chips to buffer small amounts of data is costly, as others have shown. Emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as PCM, STT-RAM, and RRAM, however, do not have destructive read operations, opening up opportunities for employing small row buffers without incurring additional area penalty and/or design complexity. In this work, we discuss and evaluate architectural changes to enable small row buffers at a low cost in NVMs. We find that on a multi-core system, reducing the row buffer size can greatly reduce main memory dynamic energy compared to a DRAM baseline with large row sizes, without greatly affecting endurance, and for some NVM technologies, leads to improved performance.},

 abstract={Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) is a promising candidate for future embedded applications. It provides desirable memory attributes such as fast access time, low cost, high density and non-volatility. However, variations in process parameters can lead to a large number of cells to fail, severely affecting the yield of the memory array. In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the impact of design parameters on parametric failures due to process variations. To achieve high memory yield without incurring expensive technology modification, we developed an alternate design paradigm ---circuit/architecture co-design --- to take advantage of different levels of design hierarchy (circuit and architecture) to improve the yield and memory density. The technique decouples the conflicting design requirements for read stability/writability and density. Consequently, the memory cell failure probability reduces by 48\% and cell area reduces by 21\% with negligible performance degradation (~0.4\%).},
